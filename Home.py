st.markdown("""
This dashboard is the front-end viewer for a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

1.  **Extract & Parse**: A backend process fetches data from Discord, parses it, and stores it in a structured format.
2.  **Transform**: A daily script reads the parsed data and pre-calculates all the statistics, leaderboards, and summaries you see on these pages. This makes the dashboard extremely fast, as it doesn't need to perform heavy calculations.
3.  **Load & View**: The final summary tables are loaded into a production database, which this Streamlit app reads from.

- **Navigation**: Use the menu on the left to switch between different reports.
- **Data**: The data is cached for performance but is refreshed every 10 minutes to ensure you're seeing the latest information from the last pipeline run.
